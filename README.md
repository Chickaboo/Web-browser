# How to change search engine

# What is planned for the future

For future updates I have many plans such adding support for downloading files. with that I would probably make or intigrate an exsting antivirus with it to make sure you are not downloading something malicious. I also may add more customization features, User Profiles, Improved error handling, Multicore threadingand other performance related thing, and bookmarks.
