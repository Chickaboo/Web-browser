# About Chicken Web-browser

This is a web-browser written in Python. It offers several features, such as downloading web pages, clearing cookies and data, and switching search engines. It uses the PyQt5 library for the graphical user interface.

# Instructions

If you do not have Git installed on your PC you can instead install the repository as a ZIP file extract it and then run the main.py. Before running if you do not have pyqt5 installed you can do

# How to change search engine

If you would like to change the search engine you can go in the setting select the search engine that you would like to use and click save. If your desired search engine it not there you can add it to search_engines.json and it should show up in the settings.

# What is planned for the future

For future updates I have many plans such adding a download manager. with that I would probably make or intigrate an exsting antivirus with it to make sure you are not downloading something malicious. I also may add more customization features, user profiles, Improved error handling, multicore threadingand other performance related thing, and bookmarks.

# Feel free to make suggestions For future updates. Any ideas/code contributions are much appreciated.
